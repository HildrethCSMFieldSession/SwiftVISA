/// - invalidSession: The given session is invalid.
/// - unsupportedOperation: The given vi does not support this operation.
/// - resourceLocked: The resource has been locked or this kind of access.
/// - timeout: The operation could not be completed in the specified time.
/// - rawWriteViolation: Violation of raw write protocol occurred during transfer.
/// - rawReadViolation: Violation of raw read protocol occurred during transfer.
/// - outputError: Device reported an output protocol error during transfer.
/// - busError: A bus error occurred during transfer.
/// - invalidSetup: The read operation could not be started becuase the settup is invalid due to attributes being set to an inconsistant state.
/// - notControllerInCharge: The interface associated with the given vi is not currently the controller in charge.
/// - noListeners: No listeners condition is detected.
/// - parityError: A parity error occured during transfer.
/// - framingError: A framing error occured during transfer.
/// - overrunError: An overrun error occured during transfer. A character was not read from the hardware before the next character arrived.
/// - ioError: An unknown I/O error occurred during transfer.
/// - connectionLost: The I/O connection for the given session was lost.
/// - returnCountExceededBufferLength: The device sent more data than the buffer could hold.
/// - couldNotDecode: The data from the device could not be decoded into a `String`.
